Project discription:
	C library intended to give C/C++ developers a quick and easy way
	to send e-mail from their applications.
	For the actual SMTP communication this library depends on libcurl.
	There is also a light version available without libcurl dependancy.
	The library can also be used to just create a multipart MIME
	message body.
	Features:
	- multiple To/Cc/Bcc recipients
	- multiple attachments without size limitation
	- multiple bodies in alternative formats (e.g: text + HTML)
	- SMTP authentication
	- TLS encryption (via libcurl)
