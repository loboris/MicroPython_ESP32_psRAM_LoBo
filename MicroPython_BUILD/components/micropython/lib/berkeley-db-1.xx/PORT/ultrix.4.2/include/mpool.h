 * The memory pool scheme is a simple one.  Each in-memory page is referenced
 * by a bucket which is threaded in up to two of three ways.  All active pages
 * are threaded on a hash chain (hashed by page number) and an lru chain.
 * Inactive pages are threaded on a free chain.  Each reference to a memory
 * pool is handed an opaque MPOOL cookie which stores all of this information.
