INTRODUCTION

Spiffs is a file system intended for SPI NOR flash devices on embedded targets.
Spiffs is designed with following characteristics in mind:

  * Small (embedded) targets, sparse RAM without heap
  * Only big areas of data (blocks) can be erased
  * An erase will reset all bits in block to ones
  * Writing pulls one to zeroes
  * Zeroes can only be pulled to ones by erase
  * Wear leveling
