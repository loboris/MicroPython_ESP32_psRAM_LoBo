Pulse Counter using ESP32 ULP processor

    Uses ULP to count pulses on GPIO4 (which is TOUCH0/RTCIO10 in RTC domain)

================================================================================

Includes debouncer taken from code as popularised by Kenneth A. Kuhn.

This is an algorithm that debounces or removes random or spurious
transitions of a digital signal read as an input by a computer.  This is
particularly applicable when the input is from a mechanical contact.

The algorithm uses integration as opposed to edge logic
(differentiation), which makes it very robust in the presence of noise.

An integrator is used to perform a time hysteresis so that the signal must
persistently be in a logical state (0 or 1) in order for the output to change
to that state.  Random transitions of the input will not affect the output
except in the rare case where statistical clustering is longer than the
specified integration time.

The following example illustrates how this algorithm works. "real signal"
represents the real intended signal with no noise.  "corrupted" has significant
random transitions added to the real signal. "integrator" represents the
integration which is constrained to be between 0 and 3.  "output" only makes a
transition when the integrator reaches either 0 or 3.

Note that the output signal lags the input signal by the integration time but
is free of spurious transitions.
